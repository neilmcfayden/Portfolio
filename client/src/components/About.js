      <h1 className="title">My Story</h1>
      <p className="para">
      I have spent the majority of my career as both a professional poker player, and the co-founder of a poker funding business. I now feel like I need a new challenge. Iâ€™d like to be involved in an industry that builds lasting products and services, and not simply be competing in a zero-sum game. 
      I decided to enrol on an intensive 12 week full-time course with General Assembly to develop core skills for a future in full stack development. Working with multiple languages and packages, I have built a portfolio that gives an accurate reflection of my current programming ability. 
      I believe the emphasis on logic and complex problem solving in poker will be transferable to software development, and I am ready to put the skills I've learned into practice. I am seeking a junior developer position, where I can learn as much as possible and hopefully add value to your organisation.
